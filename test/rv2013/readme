This directory contains examples used in the experimental evaluation of the paper "To Run What No One Has Run Before", 
submitted to RV'13.

The directory is structured as follows.
- verification: 
  Implementations of algorithms equipped with correct but generally incomplete specification. 
  Boogaloo can generate passing executions with the goal of validating specifications.
- verification_buggy: 
  Buggy versions of programs from previous directory (with either implementation or specification errors injected). 
  Boogaloo can generate failing executions and reveal bugs.
- declarative: 
  Examples of declarative programming, which exercise Boogaloo’s constraint solving capabilities 
  to generate outputs satisfying given properties, in the absence of imperative implementations.
